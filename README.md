Implementation of Model Predictive Motion Planning Network ([MPC-MPNet](https://sites.google.com/view/mpc-mpnet))

Model Predictive Motion Planning Network ([MPC-MPNet](https://sites.google.com/view/mpc-mpnet)) is a neural network-based kinodynamic planning algorithm capable of solving Kinodynamic Motion Planning tasks in seconds  with less variability and comparable path quality against a state-of-the-art algorithm that takes minutes to generate solutions with high variability.

MPC-MPNet framework could be adapted to the following two different algorithms:
